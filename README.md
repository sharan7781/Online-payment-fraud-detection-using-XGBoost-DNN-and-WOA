Online Payment Fraud Detection Using XGBoost, DNN & WOA
This project implements a hybrid fraud detection system designed to identify suspicious online payment transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. The workflow begins with data preprocessing—handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and balancing imbalanced classes.

The system uses a two-layer predictive pipeline:

XGBoost performs the initial classification and handles structured, imbalanced data efficiently.

Deep Neural Network (DNN) refines predictions by learning deeper, non-linear fraud patterns.

Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) optimizes hyperparameters across both models to maximize performance.

A responsive frontend interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time fraud checking, transaction history tracking, and admin monitoring.

The combined approach delivers high accuracy, strong recall, and reduced false positives, offering a robust solution for modern online payment security challenges.
